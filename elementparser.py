    Element Parsers are used to enforce the convention that all Element Parsers
    already know the key of the element they are constructing.

    Element Parser is a helper class that simplifies known element definition
    and makes a layer of abstraction for functionality that all known elements
    can share. The parsing interfaces are cleaner and require less coding as
    their definitions (subclasses of Element Parser) do not need to call init
    on super with class key and instance value.
